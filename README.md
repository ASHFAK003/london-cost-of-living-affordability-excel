# Cost of Living in London: Housing Affordability Analysis (Excel)

## Overview
This project analyses housing affordability across London boroughs using publicly available data on income, rent, council tax, and commuting costs. The goal was to assess how affordable London is for different household types and to explore the trade-off between housing costs and commuting time.

The entire analysis was conducted in **Microsoft Excel**, focusing on realistic analyst workflows rather than programming-based solutions.

---

## Key Questions
- How affordable is housing across London boroughs relative to income?
- How does affordability differ by gender, employment type, and household structure?
- Is there a trade-off between housing affordability and commuting time?

---

## Data Sources
- **Income data:** ONS weekly earnings by borough and demographic group  
- **Housing data:** Median rental prices by borough and property size  
- **Council tax:** Borough-level council tax bands  
- **Transport:** Average commuting time to major employment centres  

(All sources are publicly available.)

## Methodology
- Cleaned and standardised datasets within Excel  
- Combined income, rent, council tax, and transport costs into a single affordability index  
- Calculated affordability as the share of gross income required to cover essential living costs  
- Benchmarked affordability using the commonly cited 30% rent-to-income threshold  
- Used pivot tables, formulas, and charts to analyse patterns across boroughs and demographics  

---

## Key Insights
- No London borough meets the 30% affordability threshold for single renters  
- Median rent-to-income ratios suggest London is unaffordable for the average single earner  
- Dual-income households perform better, but still struggle to afford larger properties  
- Housing affordability improves further from central London, but at the cost of longer commute times

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning, formulas, pivot tables, charts, dashboards)

## Notes
This project focuses on analytical reasoning and insight generation rather than predictive modelling. Results are based on gross income figures and publicly available summary statistics, which may understate affordability pressures in practice.
